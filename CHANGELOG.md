# Changelog

All notable changes to SRP VPN Connect are recorded here. Every commit adds its entry under **Unreleased**; a TestFlight or App Store build moves those entries under its version and build number.

## Unreleased

### Added
- WaterWall profiles offer Auto Reconnect, Retry Times, Switch to Wi-Fi When Available and On Sleep under Options, like the other protocols.

### Fixed
- WaterWall Options showed the SSTP description; it now describes the WaterWall options.

## 1.2.0 (27) - 2026-10-31

### Fixed
- VMess over TLS or Reality, including TLS with ALPN, never finished connecting.
- The VPN extension could crash when a QUIC session closed or the tunnel stopped.
- HTTP/2 uploads could queue without limit until iOS ended the VPN extension for memory.
- KCP and QUIC dropped incoming data, including acknowledgements, while an app paused reading.
- QUIC stream uploads could overrun their queue while the carrier was paused.
- The VPN extension could crash when the packet budget refused a new TCP flow.
- Uploads under heavy load could be reset; the iOS TCP receive window is now bounded.

### Changed
- WaterWall applies tighter backpressure between its nodes and records more detailed diagnostics.
- Profile Save stays tappable and names the missing value instead of staying disabled.
- Obfuscator skip modes are rejected for connection input, where they corrupt data.

### Development
- The device test matrix supports key-based SSH, client-limited ports and re-executed WaterWall peers, treats UDP as not applicable in full-duplex runs, and keeps tunnel stderr and debug lines in test diagnostics.
- OpenSSL builds without assembly on fresh iOS configures.
- Added the upload stability report.
